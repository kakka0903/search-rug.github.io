title: Hybrid Partial Evaluation for Javascript
types:
- MSc
---

Partial evaluation is a technique for optimizing interpreters of programming languages. It works by fixing one of the arguments to the intepreter (i.e., the program), but leaving other parameters open (i.e., the dynamic input). A partial evaluator then "executes" the program, evaluating as much as possible. Partial evaluation is a well-research topic, both theoretically, and practically. A recent technique that claims to solve one of the problems of partial evaluation (e.g., code explosion) is Hybrid Partial Evaluation (see reference below). This original work is based on class-based OO languages (i.e., Java). The goal of this project is to transfer the idea of Hybrid partial evaluation to Javascript.
