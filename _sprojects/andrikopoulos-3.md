This project aims to investigate what is the environmental footprint of training and using chatbots. For this purpose, an open source chatbot will be used as a reference, its energy consumption on a reference machine will be established for both training and use, and the results will be used for establishing a benchmark.

More information by contacting the supervisor. *This project is intended for MSc students only due to its complexity; it can be converted into a BSc project but it can only be done as a group*.
