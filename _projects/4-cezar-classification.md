short: This project aims to form clusters of similarly scoped software systems, based
  on an NLP-informed taxonomy. This is similar to a biological classification, where
  different species (i.e., software systems) might share very few similarities, but
  they might belong to the same family (i.e., application domain)
status: In Progress
